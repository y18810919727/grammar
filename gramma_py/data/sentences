Copper alloys containing 20.8 at.% Al and 9.5 at.% Mn were made .
Characteristic transformation temperatures were determined using electrical resistivity measurements or a DuPont thermal analyser .
After annealing at 850176C and quenching in water of 55176C specimens were cut out using a spark erosion machine .
Single crystals in the shape of rods of 8 mm diameter and 80 mm length were prepared using the Bridgman method .
